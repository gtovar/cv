# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about_me_1: Past Actions Predict Future
  about_me_2: Hi, I'm Back-End Developer in Ruby on Rails and .Net, live in Monterrey, Nuevo León. A graduate of the Universidad Autónoma Nuevo León with a degree in Information Technology in January 2013.
  about_me_3: I decided involved into the world of RoR by a desire to learn something new and to my surprise was found to be completely unknown, changed almost everything, gave me new challenges, a new wave of knowledge and an interesting learning curve, changed from the Windows operating system to Ubuntu, learned many commands and focus on the console, how install applications, updates, create a new development environment versus Windows, also changed my Visual Studio editor to Vim and Tmuxinator, Internet Explorer to Chrome, ASP.net to Ruby on Rails, new architectures, 3 layers pass to work in MVC, I discovered new ways to learn a new language with the help of pair programming, the way we interact with the database was no longer the same, although topics such as MVC and EntityFramework was dominated until met Ruby on Rails, learned to do more productive following metrics and methodologies like Agile Samurai, which help you answer questions like, what is price and development time of an application?, Where am currently in the project? and What I'm doing?, if am I progress?, etc.
  about_me_4: Hundreds of hours, thousands of lines of code written, headaches, gallons of coffee, you discover that 24 hours a day is not enough to discover all new challenges like cross browser, new activities such as testing. I got many new and unknown terms. new practices, understand a little more Web Design and make blueprints, mocksup, learn that there are tools like Balsamiq, Cacoo to create diagrams, kanbanflow to measure your time, etc.. Learn how you can manage a project with the help of PivotalTracker and you can also use Github. In short it a whole world. 
  about_me_5: I think the most important thing I can conclude that it is good to have a little idea about all, many of the features of an application have been developed and are available for use, it is a Ruby core. Customers or Companies, always looking for offer quality at a good price, and this is reflected in savings of time and money, we know today, that things must be made since yesterday. No need to reinvent the wheel, the community is very creative and innovative, always suggesting and make delivery new features a clear example of this is the system that manages Ruby Gems which is great. 
  about_me_6: Currently, I would like to find opportunity especially as Back-End Developer. Front-End has many interesting topics for me as SEO, Marketing, Gamification, UX / UI and Responsive Web Design, these topics created new positions within companies, even so I like to spend more time learning programming languages  and reading books on my Kindle, always looking for the best practices, new approachment, new arguments, refactoring, case studies, new strategies, etc. As a developer, the Front-End is a fundamental part of an application and requires always modern programming languages that allow the web site to be more attractive and interactive languages like NodeJS, Ember, Angular, Knockout, Backbones, SASS, CoffeScript, etc.
  about_me_7: .Net language was always my favorite to this day and I still like it. VB.net as C#, either desktop or web, I should be grateful to .NET discover this fascinating world, I have many academic projects, and some real. The door is always open for .Net projects. If you need to know more info about my tools and their uses you can find in the description of each project in my Portafilio.

  deploy: Deploy
  programmer_box: For software development, I have more experience in Ruby on Rails, I follow a Agile Methodology. My development environment is Ubuntu, Tmuxinator and my favorite editor is VIM. Supporting the application is part of being a programmer and understand the importance of continued support after the delivery of the final product. Right now I'm transfer this knowledge to .Net
  testing_box: How to test software offers quality and reduces the margin of error and many other benefits. Good to know that new code introduced not break anything, in many cases, test are not paid or required but I try to make at least some that I consider important, using Red, Green, Refactor, TDD, some Unity test, etc. Tools used Errbit and CircleCI.
  deployment_box: Deploy a E-commerce like Spree in Digital Ocean, Create Apis or consume Apis, Services as ssh certificate, Ngnix, Capistrano, Unicorn, RailsCast and other tutorials serve me to Deploying to production,this is a task that always want to perform to finally face a cycle of implementation. Servers, services,  and settings was a part from my route to learn. Always with the mindset that everyone has things to do and you have to teach yourself.
  web_design_box: Also as all programmers need to touch Fron-End with programming languages that allow it to be attractive, interactive and improve site performance, as caching strategies, languages like NodeJS, Ember, Angular, Knockout, Backbones and go - The Go Programming Language - Google Project Hosting, are languages I would like to implement because until today, in any project are implemented yet. I really like the topics of SEO, Marketing, Gamification, UX / UI, Web Responsive Design.
